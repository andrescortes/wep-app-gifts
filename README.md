## Setting up Tailwind CSS in an Angular Project

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up Tailwind CSS in your Angular project.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following:
- Node.js and NPM installed on your machine.
## Step 1: Install Tailwind CSS
Install tailwindcss via npm, and then run the init command to generate a __tailwind.config.js__ file.
- `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`
- `npx tailwindcss init`

## Step 2: Configure your template paths
Add the paths to all of your template files in your `tailwind.config.js` file.
```
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
 content: [
   "./src/**/*.{html,ts}",
 ],
 theme: {
   extend: {},
 },
 plugins: [],
}
```

## Step 3: Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS
Add the __@tailwind__ directives for each of Tailwind’s layers to your `./src/styles.css` file.

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
## Step 4: Start your build process
Run your build process with `ng serve`.
- `ng serve`

## Step 5: Start using Tailwind in your project
Start using __Tailwind’s__ utility classes to style your content.
```
<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">
  Hello world!
